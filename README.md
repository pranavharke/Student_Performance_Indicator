## Student Performance Indicator

## Overview
The **Student Performance Indicator** project leverages machine learning to analyze and predict student's outcomes based on various academic and behavioral factors. This initiative aims to provide valuable insights for educators, institutions, and students to enhance learning outcomes and decision-making processes.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, transforms, and prepares student data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides statistical insights and visualizations using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements machine learning models to forecast student performance based on input features.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly front-end interface for interacting with the prediction system.

## Usage Instructions
- Input student data via the web interface.
- Perform an exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful insights.
- Train or use pre-trained models to predict student performance based on key factors.

## Factors Affecting Maths Score
### 1. Gender 
**Male:** Generally observed to perform slightly better in maths.
**Female:** Often excels in reading and writing but can also perform well in maths with the right support.

### 2. Race/Ethnicity üåç
* **Group A:** Represents students with limited access to educational resources and lower socio-economic status, which may impact academic performance.
* **Group B:** Includes students from moderately resourced backgrounds, showing average academic outcomes.
* **Group C:** Typically consists of students with strong academic support and better school facilities, leading to improved performance.
* **Group D:** Represents students from privileged backgrounds, often excelling due to access to tutoring, parental support, and advanced learning materials.
* **Group E:** Highly performing students with access to elite educational institutions and extensive resources, often achieving top scores.

* School quality and community environment may influence performance.

### 3. Parental Level of Education üéì
* Some High School
* High School Graduate
* Some College
* Associate‚Äôs Degree
* Bachelor‚Äôs Degree
* Master‚Äôs Degree

Higher parental education correlates with a supportive learning environment, leading to better academic outcomes.


### 4. Lunch Type üçΩÔ∏è
* **Standard:** Generally indicates better socio-economic status, correlating with better academic performance.
* **Free/Reduced:** May indicate financial constraints affecting nutrition and focus in academics.

### 5. Test Preparation Course 
* **Completed:** Often leads to better scores due to structured preparation.
* **Not Completed:** May result in lower scores due to lack of formal preparation.

### 6. Writing & Reading Scores ‚úçÔ∏èüìñ
* Directly correlated with maths performance.
* Higher reading comprehension helps understand mathematical problems.
* Strong writing skills indicate better cognitive abilities, supporting analytical thinking in maths.
